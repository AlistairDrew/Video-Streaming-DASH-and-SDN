Make sure titles arent just refrencing the coursework. Make a proper scientific paper

long paragraphs shouldn't have one citation at the beginning or the end of it. Make sure citations
are equally spread throughout and applied properly. If used it must show you've read the article. 

Look at how recent the article is and where its from. 

Demonstrate overview and depth. Usually the depth is missing.
Background is the chance to show overview. (introductiory texts) Super position, Entanglement, qbit.

wennekers hates bullet point lists 

intro
neccisary quantum physics

the deeper details 

very particular about refrences, how they are used in the text shows how well they are read and researched
